## 🧩 1. Define the Scope and Features
First, decide what your agent can do. Some common features include:

- Suggesting destinations based on user preferences (e.g., budget, interests, season).
- Creating itineraries.
- Booking flights, hotels, or tours (optional).
- Providing real-time updates (weather, events).
- Giving travel tips and cultural advice.
- Multilingual support or translation.

> Start small and expand as you go. For example, begin with itinerary creation and destination recommendations.

## 🧠 2. Choose the Type of Agent
You can build either:

- **Rule-based agent**: Uses predefined rules to make decisions (easier to build).
- **Learning-based agent**: Uses machine learning or AI models to learn from data (more advanced, e.g., using chatbots like GPT).

> If this is for a school or university project, a rule-based or hybrid system might be more realistic.

## 🛠️ 3. Design the Architecture
Here’s a high-level structure of your agent:

```
User Input → Agent → External Data Sources → Response
```

### Components:
1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - A chatbot (text-based or voice-based).
   - A web or mobile app.

2. **Agent Logic**:
   - Processes user input.
   - Decides what action to take (e.g., search for destinations, suggest activities).

3. **External Data Sources**:
   - APIs for:
     - Flight/hotel bookings (e.g., Amadeus, Skyscanner, Expedia APIs).
     - Weather (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
     - Points of interest (e.g., Google Places, Wikipedia).
     - Currency conversion, maps, etc.

4. **Knowledge Base**:
   - Store travel tips, destination info, or user preferences.

## 🗣️ 4. Use NLP for Understanding User Input
To understand what the user wants, you can use:

- **Intent Recognition**: Determine if the user is asking for flight info, a destination, or help with a visa.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract details like dates, locations, budget, etc.

Tools:
- Rasa (open-source NLP framework)
- spaCy or NLTK (Python libraries)
- Dialogflow (Google’s tool for building chatbots)

---

## 📋 5. Build the Planning Logic
This is the core of your agent. It should:

- Take user preferences (e.g., budget, interests, travel dates).
- Search for destinations that match.
- Create a daily itinerary based on the destination.
- Prioritize activities based on time and preferences.

You can use:
- Rule-based systems (if-then logic).
- AI planners (like PDDL – Planning Domain Definition Language).
- Custom algorithms.

## 💻 6. Implementation Tools & Tech Stack
Depending on your skill level and project requirements:

### Programming Language:
- Python (most common for AI and APIs)
- JavaScript (for web-based UI)

### Frameworks:
- Flask or Django (Python web frameworks)
- React (for UI)
- FastAPI (for API services)

### APIs:
- Skyscanner API (flights)
- Amadeus API
- Google Maps API
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Wikipedia API (for attractions)

---

## 🧪 7. Test and Improve
- Simulate user queries.
- Check if the agent gives relevant results.
- Get feedback from users and improve.

---

## 🧑‍💻 8. Optional: Add Machine Learning
If you want to go advanced:
- Use a recommendation system to suggest places.
- Use sentiment analysis to recommend popular spots.
- Train a chatbot using models like GPT or BERT.

---

## 📚 Example Use Case
**User Input:**  
"I want to plan a trip to Europe for 7 days, budget around $1500, with historical places and good food."

**Agent Output:**  
- Suggests Rome, Italy.
- Gives a day-by-day itinerary.
- Shows flight options and hotel suggestions.
- Adds tips about local food and weather.
